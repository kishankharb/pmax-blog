                    Hey my name is Dr Ish Major. In 2016 I made a website to receive patients online. But for 5 years I
                    didn't get more patents from the website. So I decided in 2020 that I will shut down my website. But
                    unfortunately my friend told about PMX. He says you contact PMX company. Next day I contact PMX
                    company and buy their service. I am surprised that after 3 months my website got 10 lakh traffic in
                    just 1 month. So if you are also facing the same problem. So I only recommend you to talk to PMX
                    company and tell your problem

                    Hi my name is Dr.Sandra Leeand i am currently working on our first project with PMAX whom i would
                    highly recommend to anyone looking for a full-service web development team our project includes both
                    a user-friendly responsive front-end and a full functionality fully automated back end the back end
                    alone is by no means a small project nor is it anything less than a highly complex build and just to
                    give an idea of how complex it is prior to speaking with PMAX .we were skeptical as to how much of
                    it was
                    <br> <br>

                    Even going to be possible we started our process by searching numerous sites that had ratings and
                    reviews of various web development agencies across the globe and noticed that PMAX was a name that
                    kept coming up and alongside their name were very high ratings and a lot of them from day one the
                    PMAX team dove into our project really striving to understand all of the functionality we were after
                    making suggestions sharing their knowledge with us and instilling confidence in us and in our
                    project being in california the team has been
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    amazing at being considered over time and making this 12 and a half hour time difference barely
                    noticeable due to the complexity of our project communication is key and everyone at PMAX has been
                    accessible open and easy to communicate with they are solution based they are efficient and they
                    have treated our project with great care i highly recommend PMAX for any company's web development
                    needs with an additional recommendation for the folks that we have had the pleasure of directly
                    working with
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Asha , Bassant , Murita and Padam who have all been absolutely vital to our project and who have all
                    worked hard to bring this project to life i can confidently say that we will be using PMAX for all
                    of our web development projects going forward thank you

                  <p>


                    Hi my name is Dr.Andra Tooley and i have been working at deaf diagnosis for probably about like
                    eight months or so i first reached out to them um through a google search i found them on and i
                    contacted vinnie recruit inquiring about developing an app for ios and android and it's my first
                    time doing anything like this and she scheduled the call with me right away and we had a good
                    conversation about what i was looking to create and what it would entail and then she came back to
                    me shortly after with a
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    detailed description of how that would look working with their company and how much of the costs and
                    the milestones that everything would be divided in and i thought it was actually surprisingly a lot
                    more affordable than i thought it was originally going to be and i like that it was divided into
                    milestones so it made it a lot easier for me to submit the payments uh to them that way they've been
                    patient with me as i do not know what i'm doing in terms of the terminology and even the technology
                    of developing an app that's my it's my

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    first time ever doing something like this so we have had a little bumps in the road here and there
                    and they've been patient with me in explaining the process to me and even what the terminology is
                    and what is required of me with creating certain accounts and doing certain things um the app looks
                    fantastic i'm very happy with it so far and um so far i think that it's going to be a very good app
                    and i'm happy that it turned out the way that it has they've also been really good with
                    communicating with my designer setting
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    up meetings without me to figure things out with them accommodating me when needed and i also enjoy
                    these skype meetings that we've had where we go through everything and we describe the app and how
                    to work the admin panel and all that type of stuff and if there's any questions that they made
                    themselves available to me on whatsapp um so that they can answer any of the questions that i have
                    if anything pops up so i would say that overall i'm happy with my experience and yeah i look forward
                    to continuing to work with them in the future thank you
